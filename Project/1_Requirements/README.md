# Introduction:

- Automation is control of the electrical or electronic device within area or remotely.
- It is Automation of housework or household activities.
- The automation system in residential projects refers to an integrated system in which a very minimum human intervention is required.
- A  automation system usually connects controlled devices to a central hub or gateway. 
- As there is an increase in smart house there are very intresting technology including in the system.
- One of the biggest advantages of home automation is that it keeps your abode safe, and prevents accidental fires, water leaks, gas leaks, and other disasters.
- This is one of the most marketed benefits of smart home systems. Feeling lazy to get up and switch off the lights in all rooms? No worries, with just a few taps on your mobile, you can switch on/off lights and other appliances around the place.
- Smart homes also help you in saving money. Your energy bills are reduced as you can remotely turn off devices, that you arenâ€™t using. This is a huge convenience, and you have complete control of household appliances and devices, without any extra effort.
-  Home automation has high potential for sharing data between family members or trusted individuals for personal security and could lead to energy saving measures with a positive environmental impact in the future.   
- Examples:- temprature control, light control, fan control, refridgerator control, washing machine control etc.
