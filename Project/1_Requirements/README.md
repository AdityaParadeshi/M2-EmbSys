# Introduction:

	  .Power factor is a measure of how effectively you are using electricity.
	  .It is the ratio between the Actual to Apparent Power.
	  .There are three types of load :-
	  1 Inductive Load.
	  2 Capacitive load.
	  3 Resistive load.
	  .An inductive load, like a motor, compressor or ballast, also requires Reactive Power to generate and sustain a magnetic field in order to operate. Which leads to the low power factor.
	  .Improving the PF can maximize current-carrying capacity, improve voltage to equipment, reduce power losses, and lower electric bills.
	  .The simplest way to improve power factor is to add PF correction capacitors to the electrical system.
