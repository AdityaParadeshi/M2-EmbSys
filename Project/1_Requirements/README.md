# Introduction:

- Power factor is a measure of how effectively you are using electricity.
- It is the ratio between the Actual to Apparent Power.
- There are three types of load :-
- 1 Inductive Load.
- 2 Capacitive load.
- 3 Resistive load.
- An inductive load, like a motor, compressor or ballast, also requires Reactive Power to generate and sustain a magnetic field in order to operate. Which leads to the            low power factor.
- Improving the PF can maximize current-carrying capacity, improve voltage to equipment, reduce power losses, and lower electric bills.
- The simplest way to improve power factor is to add PF correction capacitors to the electrical system.

## Swot Analysis
# Strengths
- Power Factor will be improved.
- Harmonics will be reduced.
- Electricity bill will be reduced.

# Weakness
- Appropriate Capacitor Banks must be selected.
- Continuous Monitor of Load.
- Less use of Inductive loads.

# opportunities
- Advancement in Technology.
- Improvements in the correction system.

# Threats
- Failure in Capacitor bank leads to lag in power factor.
- Low Power factor leads to increase in cable size.
- Reactive Power will be absorbed more.
