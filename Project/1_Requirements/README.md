# Abstract
- With advancement of technology things are becoming simpler and easier for us.  
- Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience. 
- Automatic systems are being preferred over manual system. 

# Introduction:

- Automation is control of the electrical or electronic device within area or remotely.
- The project deals with the safety sensors such as --> Earthquake sensor, Temprature sensor, Smoke sensor, Motion Sensor.
- When the sensors detect the input they perform the required operation and alert the person 

# Objectives
- to improve the quality of life and convenience in the home.
- Different models to be designed for security purpose.

# Swot Analysis
## Strengths
- Effecient and Intelligent energy saving Techniques.
- Safety and Security will be increased.
- Single Protocol.
- Support for Effecient operation.

## Weakness
- cost of system may be increased
- Replacement of devices will be difficult
- complex system

## opportunities
- Advancement in Technology.
- Infrastructure Management.

## Threats
- Targated Attacks
- Short lifespan of Device
- Data Manipulation
- Identity Theft
